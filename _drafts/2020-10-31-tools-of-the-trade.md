## Tools of the tradeÂ ðŸ§°

Preparing and completing your personal (and team) toolbox is the key to any form of work, even more for a digital craft.

It is mandatory that you keep a fraction of your free time to explore new solutions, sharpen your skills with your toolset and find new assets to add to your collection.

Without further ado, here's a list of some of the tools I'm using every single day:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), a rock solid multi-format editor (macOS / Windows / Linux)
- [Fork](https://git-fork.com), a pretty clean and stable user interface for **Git** (macOS / Windows)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), another user interface for **Git** (macOS / Windows)
- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com), a highly customisable terminal (macOS)
- [OhMyZsh](https://ohmyz.sh), an efficient toolbox for your terminal (macOS / Linux / Windows)
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com), a tiny App to help you manage all those pesky windows

And here, a short list of paid tools that can greatly improve or simplify your life:

- [Kaleidoscope](https://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com), a diffing tool to compare file & folders (macOS)

As previously stated, I won't go over the required tools like Xcode for Apple-related development as there are not many choices around there for such stack.
