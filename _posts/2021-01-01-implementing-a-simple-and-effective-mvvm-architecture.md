Too often, newcomers feels lost when they start App, whether it is for testing a new concept, preparing something for a technical interview and even for a new project at work.

And too often, the selected approach is to cram as much code as it is possible into the ViewControllers to the detriment of the maintainability, testability and efficiency.

There is an old joke in our field, stating that **MVC** stands for **Massive View Controller** and it would be funny if it wasn't that much of an issue.

## Purpose

The goal behind this post is to give people who recently joined the Apple development ecosystem one of the most relevant reflex to making wonderful Apps, choosing the right tool for the job.

So, if you already know your way around MVVM, VIPER, VIP and others less-known architecture, feel free to give this post a look and comment if you see something that can be improved / simplified.

It would be greatly appreciated!

## Overview

For the sake of clarity and simplicity, the implementation below will be centered around a very simple App that helps its user keep track of their bottles in their cellars.

The App, In Vino Veritas (or IVV for short), is a simple App where the user can manage its cellar by adding one or multiple bottles and removing the one which were consumed.

The App will keep track of the expiration date of each bottle and will warn the user whenever a bottle is on the verge of becoming a vulgar vinegar.

## Ye old way (aka MVC)

## MVVM to the rescue

### The Model

### The ViewModel

### Testing the whole thing (kind of)

### The ViewController

## Going further

-> MVVM + Rx
-> VIP
-> VIPER
